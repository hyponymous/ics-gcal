# ics-gcal

Simple web application that provides a drop zone for .ics files. Parses the first event defined in the file and redirects to a Google Calendar event page with the fields filled out. Quick and dirty and ES6; may not work in your old browser. Relies on the undocumented [`action=TEMPLATE`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22757908/google-calendar-render-action-template-parameter-documentation#) feature of Google Calendar.
